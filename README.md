# Catalog-Website

Catalog website template using Bolt.new

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **18** or newer
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

Install dependencies (both runtime and development):

```bash
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the development server
- `npm run build` – create a production build in the `dist` folder
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint to check code quality

If you previously installed dependencies with the `--omit=dev` flag or a
similar option, reinstall without that flag so that `npm run lint` has access to
the required dev dependencies.
